After this introductory period, the standard variable APR applies to any remaining balance.\n*   **Other APRs:** There are also separate APRs for balance transfers and cash advances, which may differ from the purchase APR.\n\n**Always check the most current and official terms and conditions on the Wells Fargo website or in your cardholder agreement for the most accurate and up-to-date information.**"
